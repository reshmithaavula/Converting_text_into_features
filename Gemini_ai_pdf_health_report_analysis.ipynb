However, the reference range is given as a dilution, requiring further interpretation by the physician.  *Salmonella Paratyphi* \"AH\" and \"BH\" titers are within the reference range.\n",
            "* **Dengue Serology:**  Negative results for Dengue NS1 antigen, IgG, and IgM antibodies indicate no evidence of current or recent dengue fever infection.\n",
